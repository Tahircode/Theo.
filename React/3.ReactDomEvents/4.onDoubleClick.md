## onDoubleClick ##
- The onDoubleClick event in React is a native DOM event that triggers when the user double-clicks on an element, typically using the left mouse button. This event is part of a group of mouse events that React handles, including onClick, onMouseDown, onMouseUp, and others.

- onDoubleClick occurs when a mouse button is pressed twice rapidly on the same element.
- The event will fire after two consecutive clicks within a short time frame, usually around 300 milliseconds. This makes it ideal for scenarios where you need to differentiate between a single click (which would use onClick) and a double-click (which requires onDoubleClick).

- Syntax:
<Element onDoubleClick={onDoubleClickHandler} />

function App() {
    const onDoubleClickHandler = () => {
        console.log("You have Clicked Twice");
    };
    return (
        <div className="App">
            <h1> Hey Geek!</h1>
            <button onDoubleClick={onDoubleClickHandler}>
                Double Click Me!
            </button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
