## onMouseDown ##

- The onMouseDown event is a native DOM event in React that triggers when the mouse button is pressed down on an element. It is part of a set of mouse events that React and the DOM handle, which includes events like onClick, onMouseUp, onMouseEnter, and others.
- onMouseDown occurs when any mouse button is pressed down (left, right, or middle).
- The event will fire before the mouse button is released. Therefore, it is an ideal event for triggering actions that should begin once the user starts interacting with an element, such as dragging, highlighting text, or starting a click-based action.

- Syntax:
 onMouseDown = {handleMouseDown}

import React, { useState } from "react";
import "./App.css";
const App = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const handleMouseDown = () => {
        setCount(count + 1);
    };

    return (
        <div className="App">
            <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
            <button onMouseDown={handleMouseDown}>Increment on Mouse Down</button>
        </div>
    );
};

export default App;
