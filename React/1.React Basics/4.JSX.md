### React JSX ###

-JSX stands for JavaScript XML, and it is a special syntax used in React to simplify building user interfaces. JSX allows you to write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript, enabling you to create UI components more efficiently. Although JSX looks like regular HTML, it’s actually a syntax extension for JavaScript.
 
 **How React Works**

-When React processes this JSX code, it converts it into JavaScript using Babel. This JavaScript code then creates real HTML elements in the browser’s DOM . which is how your web page gets displayed

*Note: Babel acts as a translator for your React code. It takes modern JavaScript (like JSX) that browsers don't understand directly. Finally, it converts it into older, compatible JavaScript so your application runs everywhere.*

**JSX Transformation Process**
 -Writing JSX: Write JSX just like HTML inside JavaScript files (React components).
 [const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;]
 -JSX Gets Transformed: JSX is not directly understood by browsers. So, it gets converted into JavaScript by a tool called Babel. After conversion, the JSX becomes equivalent to React.createElement() calls. After transformation JSX becomes.
 [const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, World!');]
 -React Creates Elements: React takes the JavaScript code generated from JSX and uses it to create real DOM elements that the browser can render on the screen.

 **Uses Of JSX**
  1. Embedding Expressions: using curly braces {}
    const name = 'Jonny';
    const greeting = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
  
  2. Using Attributes in JSX:
    [const element = <img src="" alt="A description" />;]
    -In JSX, attributes are specified similarly to HTML, but with some differences. Since JavaScript is used alongside JSX, certain attribute names are written in camelCase instead of the lowercase syntax used in HTML.
  
  3. Passing Children in JSX:
    -Children are nested elements or content that are passed into a component. This allows for flexible and reusable components.
    const Welcome = (props) => {
      return <div>{props.children}</div>;
   };

    const App = () => {
     return (
    <Welcome>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to React.</p>
    </Welcome>
  );
   };

 4. JSX Represents Objects:
   -JSX is not directly rendered as HTML by React; instead, it gets compiled into JavaScript objects representing virtual DOM elements. These objects are later used by React to efficiently update the real DOM

   const element = React.createElement(
  "button",
  {
    className: "btn",
    onClick: () => alert("Clicked!"),
  },
  "Click Me"
  );
  *The JSX code is converted into a JavaScript object*

   {
  type: 'button',                 
  props: {                        
    className: 'btn',             
    onClick: () => alert('Clicked!'), 
    children: ['Click Me']        
  }
 }
