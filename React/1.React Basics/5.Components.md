### React Components
 -In React, components are reusable, independent code blocks (A function or a class) that define the structure and behavior of the UI. They accept inputs (props or properties) and return elements that describe what should appear on the screen.

  *Key Concepts of React Components*
   -Each component handles its own logic and UI rendering.
   -Components can be reused throughout the app for consistency.
   -Components accept inputs via props and manage dynamic data using state.
   -Only the changed component re-renders, not the entire page.

 **how components work**
 Components work on a simple principle: Input->process->output
 Input (Props): The parent component passes data into the child component.
 Process (Logic): The component uses JavaScript (and Hooks like useState) to decide what to show.
 Output (JSX): The component returns HTML-like code (JSX) which React converts into DOM elements 

 **Types of React Components**

   *Category A* | By Syntax:

  1. Functional Components (Modern)
   -These are simple JavaScript functions that return React elements.
   -They use Hooks (useState, useEffect) for state and lifecycle features.
   -This is the standard today.
    e.g:
    function Greet(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
         }
 
 2. Class Components (older)
   -These are ES6 JavaScript Classes that extend React.Component.
   -They include additional features like state management and lifecycle methods.

   . State Management: State is managed using the this.state property.
   . Lifecycle Methods: Includes methods like componentDidMount,componentDidUpdate, etc.
   -They have a render() method.
   -They use this.state and lifecycle methods (componentDidMount)

   e.g:
   class Greet extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
        }
     }
  
    *Category B* | what they do ( logic )

  1. Presentational (or "Dumb") Components

   -Job: Concerned with how things look.
   -They receive data via props and just display it.
   -They usually don't have their own state (except maybe UI state like "is this menu open?").
   -Example: A Button, a Card, a Header.

  2. Container (or "Smart") Components

   -Job: Concerned with how things work.
   -They manage data, fetch APIs, and handle complex logic.
   -They usually contain State.
   -Example: UserProfilePage (fetches user data and passes it to dumb components).

  
  e.g:
   // --- PRESENTATIONAL COMPONENT (Dumb) ---
// Only cares about displaying the user info
function UserCard({ name, email, avatar }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <img src={avatar} alt="User" />
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <p>{email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
 // --- PRESENTATIONAL COMPONENT (Dumb) ---
// Only cares about displaying the user info
function UserCard({ name, email, avatar }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <img src={avatar} alt="User" />
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <p>{email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
// --- CONTAINER COMPONENT (Smart) ---
// Cares about fetching data and managing state
function UserProfilePage() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Smart logic: Fetching data
    fetch('/api/user/1')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setUser(data));
  }, []);

  // If data isn't loaded yet, show nothing or a loader
  if (!user) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  // Passing data down to the dumb component
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Profile</h1>
      <UserCard 
        name={user.name} 
        email={user.email} 
        avatar={user.avatar} 
      />
    </div>
  );
}
