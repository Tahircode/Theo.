### React Importing and Exporting Components ###

-In React, components are the building blocks of any application.    They allow developers to break down complex user interfaces into smaller, reusable pieces.

-Importing and exporting components refer to sharing and using components across different files in your application.

-React follows *JavaScript’s ES6* module system to handle imports and exports.
{JavaScript’s ES6:
ES6, or ECMAScript 2015, is the 6th version of the ECMAScript programming language. ECMAScript is the standardization of JavaScript, which was released in 2015 and subsequently renamed as ECMAScript 2015:}

**Types of Exports in React**
 1. Default Exports and Imports
 2. Named Exports and Imports

1. Default Export and Import:
A default export allows you to export a single component or variable from a file. When importing a default export, you can give it any name you choose.
e.g:
app.js:
import React from "react";
import MyComponent from "./components/MyComponent"; 

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <MyComponent /> {/* Using the imported component */}
        </div>
    );
};

export default App;

MyComponet.js:
import React from "react";

const MyComponent = () => {
    return <h1>Hello from MyComponent!</h1>;
};

export default MyComponent;


2. Named Export and Import
Named exports allow you to export multiple components or variables from a single file. When importing a named export, you must use the exact name of the exported entity.
e.g
App.js:

import { MyComponent, AnotherComponent } from "./components/ **CurlyBraces{}**
component.js";

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <MyComponent />
            <AnotherComponent />
        </div>
    );
};

export default App;

component.js:
export const MyComponent = () => {
    return <h1>Hello from MyComponent!</h1>;
};

export const AnotherComponent = () => {
    return <h1>Hello from AnotherComponent!</h1>;
};

3. Combining Default and Named Exports
You can also use both named and default exports in a single file. This is useful when you want to export a primary component (default export) and several utility components or functions (named exports).

e.g:
// Named Export
export const MyComponent = () => {
    return <h1>Hello from MyComponent!</h1>;
};

// Another Named Export
export const AnotherComponent = () => {
    return <h1>Hello from AnotherComponent!</h1>;
};

// Default Export
const DefaultComponent = () => {
    return <h1>Hello from DefaultComponent!</h1>;
};

export default DefaultComponent;

4. Exporting Multiple Components from the Same File
You might want to export several components from a single file. React allows you to use named exports for this purpose, and you can only have one default export per file.
e.g:
import React from "react";

// Component 1
export const Header = () => {
    return <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>;
};

// Component 2
export const Footer = () => {
    return <footer>© 2023 My Website</footer>;
};

// Component 3 (default export)
export default function MainContent() {
    return <div>This is the main content of the website.</div>;
}
