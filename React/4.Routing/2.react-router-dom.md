## react-router-dom ##
- React Router DOM is an npm package that enables you to implement dynamic routing in a web app. It allows you to display pages and allow users to navigate them. It is a fully-featured client and server-side routing library for React. 

- React Router Dom is used to build single-page applications i.e. applications that have many pages or components but the page is never refreshed instead the content is dynamically fetched based on the URL. This process is called Routing and it is made possible with the help of React Router Dom.

**Why Use React Router DOM?**
- React Router DOM helps React apps navigate between pages without reloading. It makes switching pages easy and organizes the app with clear routes. Here are some benefits of using React Router Dom :

. Enables Navigation Without Page Reloads: React Router DOM allows users to switch between different pages smoothly without refreshing the entire web page.
. Dynamic Routing: Dynamic routes support parameters, where the content can be customized by the input from the user.

. URL-Based Component Rendering: Each page in the app is linked to a specific URL. When the user accesses some given URL, the relevant component is loaded by React Router DOM, and this is easily handled and arranged for various views.

. Nested Routes: This allows for the definition of routes inside routes, thus complex layouts can easily be achieved.

**Components of React Router DOM**

- These components help in defining routes, handling navigation, and managing dynamic content within a React application.

1. BrowserRouter (<BrowserRouter>)
- BrowserRouter Enables routing in a React application by wrapping the entire app.
- It listens to changes in the URL and renders the correct components accordingly
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
<BrowserRouter>
    <App />
</BrowserRouter>;

2. Routes (<Routes>)
- Routes acts as a container for all <Route> components.
- Ensures that only one matching route is rendered at a time.

<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
</Routes>;

3. Route (<Route>)
- Route defines a specific path and maps it to a React component.
- When the URL matches the route path, the respective component is displayed.
<Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />

4. Link (<Link>)
- Used to navigate between pages without refreshing the page.
- Unlike <a>, it prevents full-page reloads and enhances performance.
<Link to="/about">About Us</Link>

5. NavLink (<NavLink>)

- Works like <Link> but provides active styling when the route is active.
- Useful for highlighting the active page in navigation menus.

<NavLink to="/home" className="nav-link">Home</NavLink>

6. useParams (useParams())
- useParams extracts dynamic parameters from the URL.
- Helps in fetching user-specific or product-specific details based on the route.

import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";
function UserProfile() {
    let { id } = useParams();
    return <h1>User ID: {id}</h1>;
}

7. useNavigate (useNavigate())
- useNavigate Allows programmatic navigation between routes.
- Useful for redirecting users after an action, such as form submission.
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
function Home() {
    const navigate = useNavigate();
    return <button onClick={() => navigate("/about")}>Go to About</button>;
}
