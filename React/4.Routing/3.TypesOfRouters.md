##  Types of Routers
- When creating a React application, managing navigation between different views or pages is important. React Router is the standard library for routing in React, enabling seamless navigation while maintaining the Single Page Application (SPA) behaviour.

**Types of Routers in React**

1. Browser Router (<BrowserRouter>)
2. Hash Router (<HashRouter>)
3. Memory Router (<MemoryRouter>)
4. Static Router (<StaticRouter>)
5. Native Router (<NativeRouter>)

**1. Browser Router**

- BrowserRouter is the most commonly used router in React applications that are deployed in a modern web environment.

. It uses the HTML5 history API to manage the navigation.
. This router makes use of pushState, replaceState, and the popState event to keep the UI in sync with the URL.
. It allows for clean and human-readable URLs without hash fragments.

*When to Use BrowserRouter*

- BrowserRouter is a powerful and commonly used router in React applications, and it’s ideal for web applications that require clean, SEO-friendly URLs and rely on server-side routing.

. Hosting on a Web Server with Proper Routing: BrowserRouter works best when your app is hosted on a web server that can handle dynamic URLs (server-side routing).
. Improved SEO: Since BrowserRouter generates URLs without the hash, search engines can more easily crawl and index your pages.
. Single Page Applications (SPA): BrowserRouter is commonly used in SPAs, where the entire app runs on a single page.
. Handling Multiple Views or Pages: If your app includes multiple views or pages BrowserRouter helps manage these views by linking each one to a specific URL.

**2. Memory Router**

- Memory Router is used when there is no web browser, like in testing or mobile apps. It remembers the navigation history inside the app but does not change the URL. This makes it helpful for testing and non-browser environments.

. No URL Change: Unlike Browser Router or HashRouter, MemoryRouter does not change the browser's URL. It stores the location state internally.
. In-memory history: It maintains history in memory, not in the URL or browser history, making it ideal for non-browser environments.

*When to Use Memory Router*

. Server-Side Rendering (SSR): When rendering React components on the server, where there is no URL to manage.
. Testing: Ideal for unit tests, allowing routing logic to be tested without modifying the browser’s URL.
. React Native: Since React Native doesn't rely on URLs, Memory Router helps manage navigation in mobile apps.
. Non-Browser Environments: Useful in applications like Electron where the app does not interact with a browser's URL.
. When URL Doesn’t Matter: If you don’t need to reflect state changes in the URL, Memory Router can manage routing internally

**3. Hash Router**

- A Hash Router is another type of router used in React applications. It works by using the hash portion of the URL (the part that comes after the # symbol) to manage navigation.

. It uses URL hash (#) to represent different routes (e.g., http://example.com/#/home).
. The hash part is not sent to the server but is used to change the displayed content in the browser.
. It's useful for handling navigation in environments where you can't use regular URLs (like in static websites or when there's no server-side routing).
