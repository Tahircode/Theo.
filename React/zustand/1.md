## ZUSTAND ##
- Zustand is one of many state management libraries for React. On this page we will discuss Zustand in comparison to some of these libraries, including Redux, Valtio, Jotai, and Recoil.

Each library has its own strengths and weaknesses, and we will compare key differences and similarities between each.

- Conceptually, Zustand and Redux are quite similar, both are based on an immutable state model. However, Redux requires your app to be wrapped in context providers; Zustand does not.

- npm install zustand

- import { create } from 'zustand'

const useBear = create((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increasePopulation: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
  removeAllBears: () => set({ bears: 0 }),
  updateBears: (newBears) => set({ bears: newBears }),
}))

- function BearCounter() {
  const bears = useBear((state) => state.bears)
  return <h1>{bears} bears around here...</h1>
}

function Controls() {
  const increasePopulation = useBear((state) => state.increasePopulation)
  return <button onClick={increasePopulation}>one up</button>
}
