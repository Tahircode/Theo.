## Introduction to React-Redux ##
- React-Redux is a popular state management library 
 that helps manage the application state in React applications. 
 It helps manage an application's state in a centralized way,
 making it easier to maintain and debug, especially as the
  app grows in complexity.

-It is based on three fundamental principles:

- Single Source of Truth: The entire application state is 
stored in a single JavaScript object called the store.
State is Read-Only: The only way to change the state is
 by dispatching an action that describes the change.
Changes are Made with Pure Functions: Changes to the 
state are made using reducers, which are pure functions
 that take the previous state and an action, and return the new state.

 **Core Concepts of React-Redux**
 
 1. Store
 The store is a centralized object that holds the application state.
 It is the only place where the state can be modified

2. Actions
An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes a change
 in the application state. It must have a type property and can 
 optionally include a payload.

const incrementAction = {
    type: 'INCREMENT',
    payload: 1
};

3. Reducers
A reducer is a pure function that specifies how the application’s state changes in response to an action. It takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns a new state.

const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'INCREMENT':
            return state + action.payload;
        case 'DECREMENT':
            return state - action.payload;
        default:
            return state;
    }
};

4. Dispatch
The dispatch function is used to send an action to the Redux store, triggering the reducer to process the state change.

store.dispatch(incrementAction);


5. Selectors
A selector is a function that retrieves specific pieces of state from the Redux store. It helps to abstract the state retrieval process, making it easier to access state in a more manageable way.

const selectCount = (state) => state.count;

6. Provider
The Provider component makes the Redux store available to all the components in the application. It should wrap the entire application so that any component can access the store.

import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

<Provider store={store}>
    <App />
</Provider>;

7. connect()
connect() is a function provided by React-Redux to connect React components to the Redux store. It allows the components to access the state and dispatch actions.

import { connect } from 'react-redux';

const Counter = ({ count, increment }) => (
    <div>
        <h1>{count}</h1>
        <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
);

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
    count: state.count
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
    increment: () => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT', payload: 1 })
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);

**Steps To Implement React-Redux**

1. Step 1: Setting Up the Project
 
 npx create-react-app react-redux-countercd react-redux-counter
npm install redux react-redux

2. Step 2: Define Action Types
You need to define action types, which represent the actions that will update the state.

// src/redux/actionTypes.js
export const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';
export const DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT';


3. Step 3: Action Creators
Action creators are functions that return action objects.


// src/redux/actions.js
import { INCREMENT, DECREMENT } from "./actionTypes";

export const increment = () => ({
    type: INCREMENT,
});

export const decrement = () => ({
    type: DECREMENT,
});

4. Step 4: Reducers
Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions. The reducer function receives the current state and action, and returns the updated state.


// src/redux/reducer.js
import { INCREMENT, DECREMENT } from "./actionTypes";

const initialState = {
    count: 0,
};

const counterReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case INCREMENT:
            return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
        case DECREMENT:
            return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
        default:
            return state;
    }
};

export default counterReducer;

5. Step 5: Create the Redux Store
Now, create the Redux store using the createStore function from Redux.


// src/redux/store.js
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import counterReducer from './reducer';

const store = createStore(counterReducer);

export default store;

6. Step 5: Wrap the App with the Redux Provider
Next, wrap your entire application with the Redux Provider to make the store accessible to all components in the app.


import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './redux/store';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
    <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
    </Provider>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);

7. npm start
