## useRef Hook
- The useRef Hook is a built-in React Hook that returns a mutable reference object (ref) that persists across renders. Unlike state variables, updating a ref does not trigger a component re-render.

- Syntax:
 const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);

. useRef returns an object { current: initialValue }.
. The current property can be updated without re-rendering the component.

**Implementing the useRef hook**

1. Accessing the DOM using useRef hook.
In this example, we have a button called ACTION, whenever we click on the button the onClickHandler gets triggered and it focuses the textarea with the help of useRef hook.

import React, { Fragment, useRef } from 'react';

function App() {
    const focusPoint = useRef(null);
    const onClickHandler = () => {
        focusPoint.current.value =
            "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
        focusPoint.current.focus();
    };
    return (
        <Fragment>
            <div>
                <button onClick={onClickHandler}>
                    ACTION
                </button>
            </div>
            <label>
                Click on the action button to
                focus and populate the text.
            </label><br />
            <textarea ref={focusPoint} />
        </Fragment>
    );
};
export default App;

_ In this example
. useRef creates a reference focusPoint, which allows direct manipulation of the DOM element.
. Clicking the "ACTION" button triggers onClickHandler, which sets text in the textarea and focuses it.
. <Fragment> (<>...</>) is used to group multiple elements without adding extra wrappers in the DOM.

2. Persisting Values Across Renders

In addition to accessing DOM elements, useRef is useful for storing values that persist across renders. A common use case is storing a previous value, such as the previous state or props.

import React, { useState, useRef, useEffect } from "react";
function PreviousValue() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    const prevCountRef = useRef();

    useEffect(() => {
        prevCountRef.current = count;
    }, [count]);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Current count: {count}</p>
            <p>Previous count: {prevCountRef.current}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}
export default PreviousValue;

- In this example
. count is a state variable that tracks the current count.
. prevCountRef is a reference created with useRef to store the previous count value.
. Whenever count changes, the useEffect hook updates prevCountRef.current to store the previous count.
. Clicking the button increases the count by 1 and updates both the current and previous counts

**Why Use useRef?**
- Direct DOM Manipulation: You can directly access and manipulate DOM elements without triggering a re-render.
- Persisting Values Across Renders: Use useRef to store values (such as previous state values) that should persist across renders without triggering unnecessary updates.
- Optimizing Performance: Avoiding re-renders useRef can help optimize performance, especially when managing timers, DOM references, or other non-UI values.
